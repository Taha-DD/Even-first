# Even-first
a C function that takes as input a vector T of integers and returns another vector with the even elements of T placed at the beginning.

Use this function in a main program.

The output should be as shown in the following example.

Enter the 7 elements of the vector V:

V[0] = 9

V[1] = 5

V[2] = 8

V[3] = 3

V[4] = 12

V[5] = 16

V[6] = 3

The new vector is: [8 12 16 9 5 3 3]
